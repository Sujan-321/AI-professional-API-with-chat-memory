The universe is an endless expanse that holds everything we know, from the tiniest particles to the largest galaxies. It is made up of billions of galaxies, each containing countless stars, planets, and cosmic objects, all bound together by gravity. Within our galaxy, the Milky Way, lies the solar system, which is centered around the Sun — a medium-sized star that provides light and energy to sustain life on Earth. The solar system includes eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets, all orbiting the Sun in a delicate balance. While the universe is vast and mysterious, our solar system is just a small part of it, yet it is our home and the only known place where life exists.
